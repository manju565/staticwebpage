    <h1>Four risks of using chemical fertilizers</h1>
</div>
 <div id="content1">
    <p> Fertilizers are increasingly popular because they successfully
        support plant growth and increase the yield. But what are the
        dangers of overusing fertilizers? Did you know that too much
        fertilization might cause “fertilizer burn”? Read below more about
        the negative effects of using chemical fertilizers without knowing
        your soil’s nutrient needs.</p>
 </div>
  
 <div id="heading"><span> No optimal yield due to under-fertilization or over-fertilization </span> </div>
  <div id="content1">
    <p> Soil testing before applying fertilizers is recommended in order
        to determine the soils status and nutrient need. Only then you
        know the exact type and quantity of chemical fertilizers you
        need to use. If you apply chemical fertilizers without knowing
        what your soil needs, you risk using too little chemical
        fertilizers (under-fertilization) and not achieving optimal
        yield. If you apply too much chemical fertilizers
        (over-fertilization) or apply it at the wrong time, there is a
        chance of “fertilizer burn” – scorching of plant foliage as a
        result of excess nitrogen salts. Injudicious use of fertilizers
        may result in crop damage and yield loss.</p>

    <div id="content1">
    <p>
        If you do not know what nutrients are already present in your
                soil, you might use fertilizers that your soil is already
                abundant of. That is simply a waste of money. Excessive chemical
                fertilizers will not improve your yield and might have a
                negative effect on the environment.

    <p> Soil testing provides a chemical fertilizers recommendation and
    enables farmers to apply the right chemical fertilizers and
    quantity that will be utilized by the plants. This minimizes the
    chances of applying excessive amounts of fertilizers and the
    resulting environmental damage. For example, excessive
    nitrogen-rich fertilizers might runoff from the field into water
    bodies causing an excess of nutrients in the water and rapid
    growth of plant life – a process known as eutrophication – with
    detrimental effects for water quality. </p>
